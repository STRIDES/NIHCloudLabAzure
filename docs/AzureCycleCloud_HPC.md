### Deploying and using Azure CycleCloud

Azure CycleCloud deploys autoscaling plugins on top of the supported schedulers, so users do not need to implement complex autoscaling functions and routines themselves, but rather interface only with scheduler-level configurations that they are familiar with.

## Deploy Azure CycleCloud from Azure Marketplace 

navigate to the Azure [portal](portal.azure.com) and type in "marketplace" in the search bar on top of screen.
