## Section 4 of 4 – Access Your Cloud Lab Account – *Takes about 1 minute* <a name="sec4"></a>
*Congratulations! At this point, your account is set up, and you’re ready to log in. In the future, repeat the steps in this section each time you want to access your Cloud Lab account.*

***Important:** If you plan to use Azure OpenAI services with your Cloud Lab account, you may want to submit Microsoft’s mandatory [OpenAI enablement request form](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUNTZBNzRKNlVQSFhZMU9aV09EVzYxWFdORCQlQCN0PWcu) now ([step-by-step instructions available here](azure_model_access.md) if needed). Once you submit the form, you can expect to get access to OpenAI within two to ten business days. You only need to complete this step once.*

1.	Launch the Azure portal by visiting [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/). If a login screen opens, sign in with the credentials you used to set up your account (either your university/institution username and password or your Microsoft username and password). 

2.	If your computer prompts you to approve the sign in attempt (first image below), enter the code that appears on your computer screen into the Microsoft Authenticator notification that pops up on your smartphone and then tap “Yes” (second image below).

  	![Approve sign with code message on the left and prompt for one time code on the right on app](/docs/images/AZ_gm_21.png)
