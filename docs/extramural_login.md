## Option 1 – Accessing with a Microsoft managed identify <a name="managed"></a>

*If the link takes you directly to the NIH login page (as in the photo below), then your identity is managed by Microsoft. If instead the link takes you to a fresh Microsoft login, skip ahead to the [non-managed identity](#non-managed) section.*
