## Section 4 of 4 – Access Your Cloud Lab Account – *Takes about 1 minute* <a name="sec4"></a>
*Congratulations! At this point, your account is set up, and you’re ready to log in. In the future, repeat the steps in this section each time you want to access your Cloud Lab account.*
***Important:** If you plan to use Azure OpenAI services with your Cloud Lab account, you may want to submit Microsoft’s mandatory [OpenAI enablement request form](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUNTZBNzRKNlVQSFhZMU9aV09EVzYxWFdORCQlQCN0PWcu) now ([step-by-step instructions available here](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabAzure/blob/model_access_doc/docs/azure_model_access.md) if needed). Once you submit the form, you can expect to get access to OpenAI within two to ten business days. You only need to complete this step once.*

1.	Launch the Azure portal by visiting [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/). If a login screen opens, sign in with the credentials you used to set up your account (either your university/institution username and password or your Microsoft username and password). 

2.	If your computer prompts you to approve the sign in attempt (first image below), enter the code that appears on your computer screen into the Microsoft Authenticator notification that pops up on your smartphone and then tap “Yes” (second image below).

3.	You should now arrive at the Azure homepage. You can cancel or advance through any welcome content.

4.	Check the area to the left of your profile icon under your username. If this area is blank or contains your university or institution’s name, click your profile icon and select the "Switch directory" option.
*Note: If this area already says "National Institutes of Health", you are all set and ready to use your account.*
5.	In the list of directories toward the bottom of the screen, find the "National Institutes of Health" option and click the "Switch" button next to it.

6.	Once you see "National Institutes of Health" listed next to your profile icon at the top right of the screen, you are all logged in and ready to use your $500 of Cloud Lab credits.
