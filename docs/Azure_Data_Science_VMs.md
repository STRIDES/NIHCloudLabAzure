# Azure Data Science VMs
The Azure Marketplace comes with preconfigured Data Science VMs (DSVMs). These machines come with all the different types of tools required for data analytics and machine learning within the Azure Cloud Lab. To view the available Azure DSVMs from the Marketplace search bar type in: "Data Science Virtual Machines". Once the search completes, you will be presented with the different machines available along with their hourly costs.

As an example, you can view what is pre-installed in the [Windows 2019 DSVM](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-dsvm.dsvm-win-2019?tab=Overview&culture=en-us&country=us).

## Creating a Windows 2019 DSVM
The steps to create a DSVM are basically the same as they are in creating any type of resource. You select the type of DSVM you want to build and click Create. Here is a quick example using the Windows 2019 DSVM.

The following two screen shots show the standard Create Virtual Machine start page.

Here you have the option of choosing the size of the DSVM. You should be mindful of the costs of the different sizes. It is a good idea to show the costs in hours.

Below is a screenshot of the Select sizes box.

Other than what is displayed above, the remaining steps for creating the DSVM are basically the same as for regular VMs.
